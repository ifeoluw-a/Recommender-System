# Recommender-System
A personalized music recommendation system using the Spotify dataset. Analyzes track features like energy, danceability, and loudness to provide song suggestions. Includes data clustering, t-SNE, PCA visualizations, and insights into user preferences.
The goal of this project is to develop a music recommendation system using the Spotify dataset. The system will analyze user listening habits and the characteristics of tracks (e.g., energy, danceability, loudness, etc.) to provide personalized music recommendations.
In the era of vast digital content, users are often overwhelmed by the sheer volume of choices available to them. For instance, streaming platforms like Spotify host millions of tracks. Without assistance, users may find it difficult to discover new music they would enjoy, especially beyond popular tracks. This is where a recommendation system can help.
The main problems the recommendation system will solve include:
- Overwhelming Choices: Users have access to an extensive music catalog, making it hard to manually explore all options.
Content Discovery: Users often listen to a limited subset of music. A recommendation system helps users discover new tracks and artists they wouldn’t have found on their own.
- Personalization: Users have different preferences, and a one-size-fits-all solution doesn’t work. The recommendation system provides personalized suggestions based on individual tastes.
- User Engagement: By offering relevant recommendations, the system increases user engagement, keeping them on the platform longer.
